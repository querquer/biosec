\section{Data Acquisition and Preprocessing}

\subsection{Image sets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 10 different images were taken with different motives
    \item the images can be divided into two sets
    \item the first set contains images that were suited for simple watermarks, e.g. coins, computer etc.
    \item the second set contains images that allow for nested watermarks, e.g. fountain, park etc.
    \item for this report we chose one example of each set to show the results from the evaluation
    \item should results from other images differ significantly it will be mentioned
    \item some images had to be preprocessed in order to make working with them easier
    \item for example they had to be scaled down in order to speed up the retrieving process 
    \item some images could be cropped in order to remove everything that was not needed for embedding
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Message embedding}

\begin{itemize}
    \item the used images are displayed in figures [TODO]
    \item the first image shows 8 Euro coins
    \item for this image we chose the face value of each coin as the embedding message
    \item the resulting image is shown in figure [TODO]
    \item embedding messages, first row (left to right): 50 cent, 1 Euro, 2 Euro
    \item embedding messages, second row: 10 cent, 20 cent
    \item embedding messages, third row: 1 cent, 2 cent, 5 cent

    \item the second image displays a fountain, where we embedded six messages
    \item the first message is the large water basin
    \item the second message is the large fountain, that for some part overlaps the basin
    \item with this message we wanted to test what happens to watermarks that only for some part overlap with another
    \item the last 4 messages are the four spouts at the bottom of the picture
    \item these watermarks are completely inside the first watermark
    \item here we wanted to test what happens to them if the parent watermark is damaged
    
    \item in figures [TODO] the watermarked areas are displayed
\end{itemize}
