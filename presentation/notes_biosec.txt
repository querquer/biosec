_____classification

so we come to our classification
where we also used weka for our task of the closed set speaker recognition

weka provides us a huge amount of cpossible classifier, 
which we all tried and compare the results to find the best classifier 

as the bast classifier turned out the IBK and the RandomForest with the results shown in this table
these results say that we could match samples from one recording to the origin speaker with a probability of 56%


on first sight these results doesnt look particularly well
but in the one hand we have to consider 
that the classifier was able to distinguish one sample from over 80 other speaker with a 56% which is quite well


in the other hand we have to look on the main task
the main task was not to match samples with speaker, the main task was to match recordings to speaker

due to the fact
we only used ONE recording each speaker in the test set
and only ONE speaker is speaking in the recording

we just need the majority of the sample to be classified right

lets just take a look of the results

_____covarianzmatrix

here we see all samples 
and where they were classified

we also that the classification is result is good because the majority of the sample lie on the diagonals of the matrix


on a closer look we see that
some speaker were much harder to identified as other were almost all sample were right classified


we come to our last topic

_____Doddingtons Zoo

this is a thesis we allready had in the lecture

but as a small reminder
they assume that every speaker can be assign to one of these animals
every animal represent a other charateristic of speaker

sheep, 	represent the most speaker
goats, 	where not much samples are right classified, speaker who could not authenticated are goats
lambs, 	where many wrong samples are assign to, need to look on the vertical
wolves,	where a lot of samples are classifed to few other speaker

this categorization we did with all our speaker an come to the conclusion shows in this table 
where we can see that the most are sheeps and easly to accepted by the system
and only 10% shown this unwanted feature


_____Conclusion

what did we learn about skeaper recognition in our project?
even with a non optimal database
but 
with the right tools, feature extraction and classification
it is possible 
to accomplish good results



__________slide

with:
non optimal database
good feature extraction
good classification tools
minimal post-processing

we accomplish:
97,5% authetication rate
